It's my *client-server* wich i use for course work.
***Technology stack***:mortar_board: : react(used for client) + node.js(used for server)

**What I've done?**:question:

Its just my experience of working with some technologies like node.js+react. 
Yes, its an easy one, but it were just for my pleasure.
